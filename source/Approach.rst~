Approach
============================

The project is developed as a DHIS2 Web APP.


The web API and the database
----------------------------

We have developed the stock status management tool as a web application. Data required comes from the following sources:


  #. DHIS web API
  #. Data  entered into the tool by KEMSA

Thanks to the DHIS web API we are able to query for the data required in order for our tool to function as required. The API allows us to query for:

	- Counties (their name. id and parent id)
	- County Level drugs
	- Central Level drugs
	- Sub-counties (their name, id, parent id)
	- Mapping
	- Facilities

This data is then used to populate the respective tables in the database.
