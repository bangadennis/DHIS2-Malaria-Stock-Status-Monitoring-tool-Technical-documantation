Software Environment Tools and Components
============================================

The Malaria Stock Status Management system needs to be installed on a web server.

Web server software requirements
---------------------------------

    #. PHP 5.3.2+
    #. One of the following operating systems:

		    - Linux/Unix/BSD
		    - Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Vista, Windows 7, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2
		    - Mac OS X 10.4+
		    
	#. Database:
			- MySQL 5.0+

	#. Web server:
		- Apache 2.0+

Web server hardware requirements
----------------------------------

Hardware requirements vary widely depending on the traffic to the system, the complexity of its logic (i.e., PHP), and its size (i.e., database.) By default, all pages are dynamic, and thus access both the database and execute PHP code to generate. 

The recommendations for the hardware are:

	#. Atleast 50 GB disk space in the server.
	#. Atleast 5 GB RAM

Client side requirements
-------------------------------
The malaria stock status is designed to work  well with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 8+. The application works well across Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.
