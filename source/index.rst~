DHIS2 Stock status monitoring project documentation
==================================================
MSH/HCSM is a key member of the Malaria drug management subcommittee, which is involved in the stockstatus monitoring 
of Malaria commodities both at the National and County levels.

On a monthly basis, the Malaria Control Unit, drug management committee meets to review the stock status ofmalaria commodities 
in the country, by analyzing data from various sources including:
	#. Facility and County Level Stock Data from DHIS.
	#. National Level Stock Status data from the Supply Chain Agencies (KEMSA).
	#. Pipeline information based on incoming shipments per funding agency.

This data is aggregated and analyzed for the different malaria commodities and a 2 pager report generated that
indicates to management, the months stock status and pipeline monitoring of Malaria commodities. Currently
MCU uses an excel based tool to generate this information. The current requirement is to amend and enhance
the current 2 pager tool to accommodate additional requirements including representation of Central and
county level data for Malaria commodities, and to color code the different pending shipments based on the
timelines for delivery. This request makes the current tool being used to develop the 2 pager report redundant
as it will not meet the requirements of the Malaria control unit and the donor, hence the need to develop a new
tool.
