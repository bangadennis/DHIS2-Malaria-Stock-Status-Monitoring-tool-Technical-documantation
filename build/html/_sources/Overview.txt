The Stock Status Management tool analyzes data from various sources including:

#. Facility and County Level Stock Data from DHIS.
#. National Level Stock Status data from the Supply Chain Agencies (KEMSA)
#. Pipeline information based on incoming shipments per funding agency



This data is aggregated and analyzed for the different malaria commodities and a 2 pager report generated that indicates to management, the months stock status and pipeline status and pipeline status of malaria commodities. 

This tool is meant to amend and enhance the current 2 pager tool used by MCU to accomodate additional requirements including representation of Central and county level data for malaria commodities, and to color code the diffeent pending shipments based on the timelines for delivery.
